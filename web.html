        <h4>1. Introduction to Web Technologies: FAB MEMBERS will be introduced to the basic concepts of the internet, web browsers, and how websites work. They will learn about the client-server model and the role of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in building websites.
        </h4>
        <h4>
            2. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):FAB MEMBERS will learn the structure of web pages using HTML. They'll understand how to create headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and other essential HTML elements.</h4>
            <h4>
                3. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): This section covers the basics of CSS, teaching FAB MEMBERS how to style their web pages by controlling layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects.</h4>
                <h4>
                    4. JavaScript Fundamentals:An introduction to JavaScript programming will cover essential concepts like variables, data types, conditions, loops, and functions. Participants will learn how to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to their websites.</h4>
                    <h4>5. Project Work:Throughout the module, participants will work on hands-on projects that gradually increase in complexity. These projects will allow them to apply the concepts they've learned and build a portfolio of their web development skills.
                    </h4>
                    <h3>By the end of the Web Development module, participants should have a strong understanding of the core technologies behind websites and have the skills necessary to design, develop, and deploy their web projects. This knowledge can serve as a solid foundation for further exploration into more advanced web development topics.</h3>
